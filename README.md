An app that promotes Biblical emotional health. 

## The Problem 

We face various different emotions throughout the day and many a times, we do not react in a healthy way to them. 
We live in a world that preaches to “follow your heart”. 
Unfortunately, following our hearts most of times lead to poor decisions led by our flawed flesh and limited human understanding. 
> “The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it?”
>
> Jeremiah 17:9

It leads us to irrational decisions and the desires of our heart & flesh.
